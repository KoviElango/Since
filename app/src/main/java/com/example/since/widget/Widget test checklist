# Widget Final Test Checklist

## 1. App freshly launched (no active streak)
- Widget shows:
  - "No active streak" message.

## 2. Start a new streak (create first streak)
- Widget immediately shows:
  - "0" days counter (large text).
- Message below says:
  - "day since..." if 1 day
  - "days since..." otherwise

## 3. Let 24 hours pass (or manually simulate by editing timestamp if needed)
- Widget correctly shows:
  - "1" day after full 24h.

## 4. Reset the streak
- Widget immediately switches to:
  - "No active streak" message.

## 5. Start a new streak again
- Widget immediately switches to:
  - "0" days again.

# If all 5 basic tests pass:
- Widget save + load cycle is 100% clean.
- Widget state is correctly driven by resetTimestamp + isActive.
- No ghost data, no stale data, no random errors.
- Production ready.

# In short:

- Widget shows "0 days" when starting a streak
- Widget shows "No active streak" when reset
- Widget responds immediately without needing manual refresh
- ViewModel saves data cleanly with updateWidget(resetTime, isActive)
- Architecture is clean and scalable
